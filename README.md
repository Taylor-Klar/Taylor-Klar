  <summary>✨ More About Me</summary>
  Hello, my name is Taylor and one really cool fact is that I have adopted two special needs cats! They're purr-fect!
  <br><br>Before getting into coding, I previously worked in fashion & design where I designed window displays for very luxury department stores. I also was in charge of dressing the mannequins in the store too. That part was probably my favorite because I was able to watch in real time as the outfits I styled sold out because people liked what they saw the mannequins wearing. I have my A.A. degree in Visual Communications from The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and feel very lucky to have spent so much time in the design and fashion world because I believe this gives me an eye for composition when it comes to being a developer.
  
<br>After a number of years, I left the fashion industry and joined the world of finance! I have previously held positions where I lead an Accounts Receivable team at a CPA firm where I reported directly to the President, Controller, and Shareholders. I have also worked on the AR team for tech companies such as Yelp! and I have even worked in payroll where I processed multi-state payroll for over 200 employees.

<br>Outside of work, I am passionate about animal welfare and hope to open my own rescue one day. I love to read and always have a large stack of "to be read" books next to my bed. I am born and raised in Southern California, currently living in Arizona but if I could live anywhere in the world, it would either be in Mexico or Germany. Both languages, I am currently studying!
 
<br>Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet! I hope we connect and chat soon!
